# Microbenchmarks

This directory contains microbenchmarks for tracking the performance
of specific language constructs and intrinsic functions.  They do not
correspond to any published benchmark(s), and are not representative
of application-level performance.

Some of these benchmarks generate fairly large data sets automatically
(using ``random input`` test stanzas).  You may need several GiB of
free space to run them.
