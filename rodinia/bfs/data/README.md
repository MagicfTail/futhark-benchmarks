# Datasets

`verysmall` is hand-written.

`4096nodes` originate from Rodinia, though their input and output formats has
been converted to Futhark's format.

`4096nodes_high_edge_variance` are generated by `date/gen_datasets.py`, which
does the same as Rodinia's internal `graphgen` utility, except with no duplicate
edges.  (`graphgen` might generate duplicate edges, which is bad, but it only
starts potentially failing when the number of edges becomes large.)
