# BabelStream

This directory contains Futhark implementations of the
[BabelStream](https://github.com/UoB-HPC/BabelStream) benchmarks.
These are quite small and mostly concerned with measuring memory
bandwidth.  They are interesting because they investigate whether we
get the really fine details right (and allows comparison with other
implementations).
