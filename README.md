futhark-benchmarks
==================

Futhark implementations of various benchmarks.  The intention is that
these implementations are of existing published benchmarks, and thus
show where we do well or poorly.

Todo: a nice way of running all the programs and getting a useful
execution summary.  You can run everything that runs with:

    futhark-test $(find . -name '*fut')
