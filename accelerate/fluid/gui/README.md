Fluid GUI!
==

Run `make` (it takes a little while), then `./fluid-gui.py 256` to run
a 256x256 fluid simulation.

Draw with the right mouse button pressed to add particles.  Move the
cursor with the left mouse button pressed to add forces.  Press C to
clear all particles and forces.

Note that the simulation is fairly heavyweight, so while you can
increase the size if you have a beefy GPU, you probably cannot run at
high resolutions at acceptable frame rates.
