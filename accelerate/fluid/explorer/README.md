Fluid Explorer!
==

Run `make` (it takes a little while), then `./fluid-explorer 256` to
run a 256x256 fluid simulation.  Use the left and right mouse buttons
to add particles and forces.

Note that the simulation is fairly heavyweight, so while you can
increase the size if you have a beefy GPU, you probably cannot run at
high resolutions at acceptable frame rates.
