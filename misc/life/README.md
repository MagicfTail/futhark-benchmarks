Game of Life in Futhark
==

Just run `make` to build, then `python life-gui.py`.  Requires
the Futhark compiler, Pygame and PyOpenCL.  And of course, a working
OpenCL setup.

Several rule sets are supported.  Some of them have distinct
behaviour, while others are only different in how they are visualised.
Press `Space` to cycle between them.
