Game of Life in Futhark
==

Just run `make` to build, then `python life-gui.py`.  Requires
the Futhark compiler, Pygame and PyOpenCL.  And of course, a working
OpenCL setup.

Several rule sets are supported.  Some of them have distinct
behaviour, while others are only different in how they are visualised.
Press the left and right arrow keys to move between them.
